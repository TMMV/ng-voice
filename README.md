ng-voice
========

This is a demo for a directive called ng-voice. Just add "voice" to any '''<a>''' tag and it will automatically access its href every time the text inside is called. It uses the great <a href="https://www.talater.com/annyang/">annyang's library</a> for voice recognition and can be used in several languages thanks to <a href="https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate">angular-translate</a>.

example: ```<a href=""google.com voice>Google</a>``` (this will open google everytime you say "Google")
